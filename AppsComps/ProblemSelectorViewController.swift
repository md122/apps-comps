/* PLANS FOR NEXT TERM
 -user should retrieve information from Teacher or Student class, not Account class.
 //Actually it might need to be global
 -create a UIButton class which takes in the level and accordingly becomes enable/disabled (green or grey). 
 -level should also be taken from teacher/student class, or the global class
